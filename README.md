# WBSFLIX_Recommendation_Systems

Create a recommender system that give users of WBSFLIX relevant content to watch.

As a freelance Data Scientist, a customer approaches you with an ambitious request: she wants to take her DVD store online. And you thought all DVD stores were dead! Not quite: her store, called WBSFLIX, operates in a small town near Berlin and is still alive thanks to a loyal customer base that appreciates the local atmosphere and, more than anything, the personal recommendations of the owner, Ursula.
